#Goal

Build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

#Task

1.) Create a Record Data Class that consists of the `sender`, `receiver`, and
`amount` attributes.

2.) Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

3.)Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface. Delete input data varible, add input area for Sender, Receiver, & Amount.

4.) Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
